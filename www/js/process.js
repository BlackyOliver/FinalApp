In birds and mammals, they contain branched bones or cartilages called turbinates, whose function is to warm air on inhalation and remove moisture on exhalation. </p></center>

 <center><p> Paranasal sinuses are a group of four paired air-filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity. The maxillary sinuses are located under the eyes; the frontal sinuses are above the eyes; the ethmoidal sinuses are between the eyes and the sphenoidal sinuses are behind the eyes. </p></center>

 <center><p> The epiglottis is a flap made of elastic cartilage covered with a mucous membrane, attached to the entrance of the larynx. It projects obliquely upwards behind the tongue and the hyoid bone, pointing dorsally. It stands open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. </p></center>

 <center><p> The larynx, commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the top of the neck of tetrapods involved in breathing, producing sound, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. </p></center>

 <center><p> The trachea, colloquially called the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. </p></center>

 <center><p> There are 10 bronchopulmonary segments in the right lung: three in the superior lobe, two in the middle lobe, and five in the inferior lobe. Some of the segments may fuse in the left lung to form usually 8-9 segments (4–5 in the upper lobe and 4–5 in the lower lobe). </p></center>

 <center><p>Right middle lobe syndrome (RMLS) generally refers to atelectasis in the right middle lobe of the lung. It is caused by various etiologies and has no consistent clinical definition </p></center>

 <center><p>A major organ of the endocrine system, the anteriorpituitary (also called the adenohypophysis or parsanterior), is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland (hypophysis). </p></center>
